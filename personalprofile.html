<h3>So, what does this mean?</h3>
<p>Let's break up the results first.</p>

<p><b>Myer-Briggs Test: ENFP</b></p>
<p>The campaigner is often described as a true spirit. Their strength relies on their curiosity, observance, enthusiasm, communication, and friendliness. On the other hand, their most common weaknesses are their poor practical skills, inability to stay focused, and poor management of emotions.
Is this me? Honestly? The weaknessess definitely are. I want to say yes to the strengths as well but I don't think I'm too observant. Having known my strengths and weaknesses, I don't think they fare too badly within the work environment. I mean, <i>yes I get extremely stressed and anxious when under pressure and may sometimes react negatively to criticism,</i> but on the other hand, I am also (supposedly) very good at communicating and  using this skill to link to others and share ideas. Which, personally, I think is a great trade off in this field.
IT for me is all about communicating effectively and team work to make ideas come to life. 
<br><br> Some thing I definitely need to take into account when forming teams is to find organised and disciplined individuals. I bring the ideas, partner #1 brings the plan, and partner #2 brings the drive. Together, we are the dream team. All jokes aside, those would most likely be the best types of people for me to work with and learn from. </p>

<p><b>Learning Style: Visual</b></p>
<p>Well, 50% visual, 35% tactile, and 15% auditory. And honestly, is 50% even that high? I think we'll settle for a visual-auditory learning style, which basically means just that. I learn best by reading or seeing pictures and remember best by sight, which is ironic considering my eyesight is terrible. Being a (mostly) visual learner also means i'm generally quite neat and clean. The test also points out that I have difficulty with spoken direcyions and that is 100% true. 
<br><br>How accurate is my learning style? 100%. It recommends: visualising things that I hear, writing down key words and ideas, drawing diagrams and pictures to explain concepts, color coding, and sitting near the front of the class room. Check, check, check, check, and check.
To me, being a visual learner doesn't affect nor inhibits my ability within the work force, therefore not much to take into account when forming teams.
</p>

<p><b>The Big Five Test</b></p>
<p>From the results above, a quick summary of my Big-Five personality:
<ul>
	<li>High openness to experience: open-minded, experiemental, creative conceptual problem-solving</li>
	<li>Low consientiousness (work ethic): spontaneous, prefers flexible planning, dislikes precise details </li>
	<li>Neutral extraversion: well, simply put that i'm an ambivert.</li>
	<li>Neutral agreeableness: i guess i'm simultaneously both competitive but co-operative? A good balance I suppose? :D </li>
	<li>High natural reactions: prone to worry, bad emotional management</li>
</ul>
Well. I'm definitely happy with most of my results, though my work ethic comes as a bit of a concern especially given it's relation to a work environment. Can I say that the test was wrong about my work ethics? No :(. But truthfully, I definitely am not a 9-5 person. I thrive best in flexibility, and thus may have some problems finding a good position.
I'm not too particularly worried as I don't want to be forced into a static work environment. It is something i definitely need to keep in mind when job-hunting, and will most likely be looking for roles that are project based opposed to hourly based. I don't think it'll be too much of an issue within the IT field as there are many roles that are off-site and handle lots of projects. Especially given the type of work done, I think we can mostly agree that when developing or solving issues, it is something that is hard to do when we simply don't feel it. Like a writer's block, we can't just assume that coding will be easy to do 8 hours straight, everyday. Or at least, I definitely don't think it is.
I am a bit concerned if I were to get into a static role, mostly because I don't want to be putting my team down. However, as long as it is done, I hope it won't be too much of an issue :D. </p>
