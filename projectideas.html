  <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
  <p>I'm not sure what type of project idea is expected, and as stated previous in my ideal job I will need to be doing a lot of indie work on games and such. 
I do have one project idea I want to work on before anything else. A personal project for me, something I plan to complete one day regardless of learning IT or not.

<br><br><br>What is AloeBot? <br>
AloeBot is an AI featuring a friendly home for your plant and bringing it to life! How many times have you tried (and failed) to grow your succulents and plants? Well, too many times for me. To put a stop to this, AloeBot features moisture and sunlight indicators that is backed with plant information to help alert you on your plant’s wellbeing. 
<br><br>
Why AloeBot? <br>
As a single child being raised by a single mother, life was… lonely. I then created the idea of AloeBot. I wanted to create something to replicate a pet or a friend for those of us who wanted a companion. “So why not just get a pet?” For those leading pro-active and busy lifestyles, setting time aside to look after and teach a pet is just outside of their capabilities. “What about AI pets?” My idea of AloeBot is to create something unique that does not yet exist and having an AI pet will never be as close (or as good!) as having a real pet. Instead, I focused my idea on things I wish were alive. Things many of us have in our homes but will never speak. And in a way, something to help just a bit with our environment. So AloeBot came to life, because there will never be a yearning for a real talking plant. AloeBot is just AloeBot, and there is no better AloeBot than the AloeBot you have.

<br><br>
Why I wish to see this come to life. <br>
I will work hard to bring AloeBot come to life, to help those of us who are lonely, or those who seek companionship and those who struggle socially. Studies have shown that owning pets helps greatly with social development as well as emotional development, but again not all of us can afford the time or finance of owning a real pet. I think AloeBot can be a compromise between that. AloeBot is not only a home device, it can be a work device too. Because It also acts as a air quality controller and calendar, it also helps those with busy lifestyles to stay organised and safe. I hope one day I can complete this task, because even helping just one person is what AloeBot is here for.
Developing AloeBot will also give me the skills to implement and create AI, which in turn will help me towards my goal of being a gaming developer as well as testing and analysing projects. I think developing AloeBot just covers a bit of every aspect of IT and will surely give me some extra advantage over my competitors!

<br><br>
AloeBot features: <br>
“Okay, I’m sure there are already devices that do so already?” And you’re right. I’m sure these devices do exist. So what makes AloeBot different? <br>
AloeBot is also a smart home device that doubles as a chatbot as well.  It will feature:
<ul>
<li>Vocal understanding to recognise and respond to commands. AloeBot acts almost like a pet, responding to you firstly and has the ability to learn and recognise others as well </li
<li>AI capable of learning and adapting to you, therefore no two AloeBot will ever be the same! A big factor of being a good companion is the time that you shared and the bond that you build. AI learning allows AloeBot to grow to and with you. My goal is to have AloeBot understand and continue jokes, to recognise and learn emotions and to also live independently (not only responding to their owner’s commands). How “alive” your AloeBot is will be dependent on your responses when AloeBot is growing </li>
<li>Time, temperature, air quality control, calendar. My idea of AloeBot is to get rid of all the junk on your table and smashing it all onto one to provide a simple, minimalistic working space for your desk. AloeBot will feature a computer software where you can analyse the air quality, make calendar entries and check the forecast </li>
<li>AloeBot is open software which means you can fully customise AloeBot to be the way you want! You will be able to customise the way AloeBot’s facial responses look like, as well as the way your calendar and time look. AloeBot allows you to program games to be played on it’s screen, as well as, well, whatever you can think of!</li>
<li>AloeBot will also adapt music playing platforms and acts as a radio/music player as well </li> 
<li>Interactive facial recognition and emotions, AloeBot will let you know how it feels via facial expressions on it’s screen! That way you stay alerted on when your plant needs water, or wants to chat with you! AloeBot can also respond via voice responses or simply words on screen!</li>
<li>AloeBot will also feature a timer to help those studying. It will come pre-installed with a pomodoro timer, however it’s open source platform allows users to add or download much more styles! </li>
</ul>

<p>AloeBot also features: customisable template for the outside, screens with interchangable purposes, OLED screen to reduce glaring and provide high quality images, and water and shock proof material. Other materials will also be included especially within the inside. The inside is also removable so you don't have to worry about damaging your AloeBot when changing soil etc!
